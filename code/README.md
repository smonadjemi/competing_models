#### Environment Setup:

This project was tested with `python 3.6` on a MacOS machine. In order to execute any of the codes in this project, 
first install the required libraries into a virtual environment and activate it using `pipenv` (from `code/` directory):


```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

**Note:** If `pipenv` is not already installed, execute `pip install pipenv` first, assuming `pip` refers to `Python 3.6`
package manager.
